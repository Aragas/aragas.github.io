Projects:  
[iBank.Operator.Desktop](https://github.com/mcap-ibank/iBank.Operator.Desktop) - WPF application (ported WinForms) used by the banking department for preparing the process of issuing and actually issuing VTB bank cards for draftees.  
Imported and handled Excel files, exported reports in both Excel and Word formats.
